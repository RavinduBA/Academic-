✅ How Vercel + GitHub Integration Works

When you connect a Vercel project to a GitHub repo:

Automatic Deployments on Push:
Vercel automatically deploys your app every time you push or merge changes to the connected branch (e.g., main or master).
This includes fixes, new features, or even small typo commits.

First Deploy Fails Due to Config Error:
If your initial deploy fails due to a misconfiguration (like a wrong build command or missing dependency), Vercel doesn’t stop watching your repo.
When you fix the issue in code and push the change, Vercel automatically tries again, thinking: “Oh, a new commit! Let me deploy the latest version.”

No Manual Confirmation Needed:
Once connected, Vercel doesn’t require your permission for future deployments — it assumes you want the latest version deployed automatically.

🔒 How to Control This Behavior

If you'd like more control over when deployments happen:
Use a separate “development” branch for work and only merge to main when you're ready.
Or go to Vercel Dashboard > Project Settings > Git > Production Branch and set it to a stable branch (e.g., release) so main doesn't auto-deploy.

🚨 Bonus Tip

To stop auto-deployment temporarily:

Pause the Git integration in the Settings > Git tab of your project.
Or set up Preview Deployments only, and promote to Production manually when ready.





How CI/CD Works in Vercel

In Vercel's case:

Continuous Integration (CI):
Every time you push code to GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket), Vercel runs a build and checks if your code compiles and passes basic checks.

Continuous Deployment (CD):
If the build is successful, Vercel automatically deploys the result to a live environment — either a Preview Deployment or Production Deployment, depending on the branch.

So yes, CI/CD is built-in and automatic with Vercel once it's connected to your Git repo.


🔄 Is the branching strategy common outside of Vercel?

Absolutely. This is a standard Git workflow used in many CI/CD pipelines across platforms like:

    GitHub Actions

    GitLab CI/CD

    CircleCI

    Jenkins

    Netlify

    AWS Amplify

    Azure DevOps

    and more...

Here’s a breakdown of common workflows:
🔀 Common Branching Strategy (used everywhere)
Branch	        Purpose
main or master	Always production-ready. Deployed to live environments.
dev or develop	Work-in-progress branch where features are integrated.
feature/xyz	Short-lived branches for specific features or fixes.
release/x.y.z	Optional: Prepares for a new version, tested before merging to main.
hotfix/xyz	Critical fix branches directly off main.
