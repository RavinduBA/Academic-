Software testing

Software testing is verifying that our software application  meets the specific requirements and functionalities correctly.


Types of Software Testing

1. Functional testing -(testing the code)
 Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, Acceptance Testing

2. Non-Functional Testing - (testing the performance ,scalability , load balancing )
Performance Testing,Security Testing, Usability Testing, Compatibility Testing

Testing Methodologies - Manual Testing (giving inputs and checking outputs like things)
                        Automated Testing (write scripts to automate testing EX:JUnit testing)


Black box testing - its like you give the input and checking the output (EX : when buying a phone)
White box testing - its like checking the actual code not just externally but internally 

Testing Levels

1.Unit Testing
So in unit testing  basically we test each classes , components  witch is unit . (in java we use Junit)

2.Integration Testing
Checks the interaction between integrated units or components.

3.System Testing
overall testing of the system 

4.Acceptance Testing
Ensures the software meets business requirements and is ready for production use.


why we do software testing
1. to ensure the software performs its intended functions correctly.
2. to Detect security vulnerabilities
3. to check softwareâ€™s behavior under expected and peak load conditions.
4. to Confirm that the software meets the business and user requirements.





just some words meaning


Load blancing  - Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed

Scalability    - Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources, either by scaling up (vertical scaling) or scaling out (horizontal scaling). It ensures that a system can grow to accommodate more work or users without sacrificing performance.
