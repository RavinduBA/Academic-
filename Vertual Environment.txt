you can create an isolated environment for local development, and it’s a common best practice — especially in Python projects. Your specific requirement is to work locally without installing dependencies globally, which is exactly what Python virtual environments and tools like pipenv or poetry are designed for.

✅ Goal:
You want to use the packages in requirements.txt without installing them globally.

✅ Solution 1: Use venv (built-in for Python 3.3+)
🔹 Step-by-step:

# 1. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Activate the environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install packages from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

✅ Now all packages are installed only in the venv/ folder, not globally.

💡 Tips:
- Add venv/ to .gitignore to avoid committing the virtual environment.
- Use deactivate to exit the virtual environment.
- Keep your requirements.txt updated with pip freeze > requirements.txt.

✅ When you exit your IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.):

You don’t need to manually deactivate the virtual environment when closing the IDE or terminal — it gets deactivated automatically when the terminal session ends or the IDE is closed.
💡So, deactivating is optional when you're exiting. You can just close your IDE or terminal.

🔄 When you reopen the IDE or terminal and want to run your project again:

Yes, you need to activate the virtual environment again before running your Python scripts.
👉 Do this every time you open the terminal:

On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

🔁 Optional: Automate it in VS Code

If you're using VS Code, it can auto-activate the virtual environment when opening the project:
Make sure your venv folder is in your project directory.
Open VS Code in that folder.
In the bottom-left corner, click the Python interpreter and choose ./venv/bin/python or .\venv\Scripts\python.exe.
VS Code will now remember and auto-activate the environment when you open the terminal inside it.


❌ Do NOT commit the virtual environment
Why?
    It's large and platform-dependent (Linux/Mac vs Windows).
    Contains compiled binaries and temporary files.
    Can be regenerated easily using requirements.txt.

✅ What you should commit
    Your codebase
    requirements.txt (created with pip freeze > requirements.txt)
    A .gitignore file to exclude venv/

✅ Add venv/ to .gitignore
Create a .gitignore file if you don’t have one and add:

venv/
.env
__pycache__/
*.pyc

📦 How others can use your project

When someone else clones your repo from GitHub:

Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

Activate it
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

And they're ready to go!
